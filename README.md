# LBA2R2I

This program will take decompressed saves, and output to basically any image format you'd like.

## Usage

`lba2r2i <input_file> <output_image>`

Simple as that, provide it a decompressed save, then tell it what you'd like the image file to be named and what extension you'd like (.png, .avif, .jpeg, whatever really) and it will output the image from your save file to that file type.

My save decompressor should cover exxtracting from compressed saves, as this program isn't designed to work with the compressed saves.
